Reading Notes Journal D102

My name is **Cody**! I like to pet random dogs at the park!

Growth Mindset to me is believing that intelligence can be developed. The ability to engage and persist when faced with challenges.

Three reminders to stay in a growth Mindset:

  1. Mistakes are a natural part of the learning process.

  2. Analyze the patterns and learn to adjust accordingly.

  3. ***Attitude and effort determine everything!***
