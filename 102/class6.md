# Class 6 Notes

- JavaScript Variables

  - What are Variables?
    Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).

- When to Use JavaScript var?
   - Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst.

   - The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

   - The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

   - If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use var.


- When to Use JavaScript const?
   - If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.

   - If you think the value of the variable can change, use let. 

- Just Like Algebra
   - Just like in algebra, variables hold values!

- JavaScript Identifiers

  All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

  These unique names are called identifiers.

  Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

  The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

   - Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
   - Names must begin with a letter.
   - Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
   - Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
   - Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

- The Assignment Operator
  - In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.

  - This is different from algebra.
