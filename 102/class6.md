# Class 6 Notes

>> Javascript Object Basics

1.How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
  - In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color,    a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.
  
2.What are some advantages to creating object literals?
  - The advantages of using object literals to create objects include convenience, flexibility in declaration, and less code during declaration.
  
3.How do objects differ from arrays?
  - Objects represent “things” with characteristics (aka properties), while arrays create and store lists of data in a single variable.
  
4.Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object’s property instead of dot notation.
  - Bracket notation can run arbitrary JavaScript. Dot notation didn't allow this, and was more restrictive with its syntax. For example, you couldn't use characters       like + or - in its name.
  
5.Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?
  - The "this" keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used. -Constructors, when the parameter name is the same as an instance variable
  
>> Introduction to the DOM

1.What is the DOM?
  -The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents
  
2.Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.
  -Document Object Model or DOM is an interface that defines how the browser reads your XML or HTML document. JavaScript is allowed to manipulate structure & style        your webpage. Once the browser reads the HTML document, it creates a representational tree known as the Document Object Model.
