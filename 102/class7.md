# Class 7 Notes

>> Domain Modeling

1.Explain why we need domain modeling.
  - Domain-specific modelling enables developers to separate previously connected development activities for a software system
  
  
>> HTML Table Basics

1.Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
  -mixes presentational data in with your content.
  -This makes redesigns of existing sites and content extremely labor intensive (and expensive).
  -It also makes it extremely hard (and expensive) to maintain visual consistency throughout a site.
  
2.List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <.table>.
  - <.article> = This element specifies independent, self-contained content.
  - <.header> = This element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.
  - <.nav> = This element defines a set of navigation links.
 

>> Introducing Constructors

1.What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
  - We have to write out the same code for every object we create, and if we want to change some properties of the object - like adding a height property - then we 	have to remember to update every object.

2.How does the term "this" differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
  - Creating more than one object literal, "this" enables you to use the same method definition for every object you create.
  - Binding "this" to the new object, so you can refer to this in your constructor code


>> Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

1.Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience
  - Prototypical inheritance refers to the ability to access object properties from another object. We use a JavaScript prototype to add new properties and methods to 	   an existing object constructor. We can then essentially tell our JS code to inherit properties from a prototype
