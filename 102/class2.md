# Class 2 Notes

What I learned:

- A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor is one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

- You can use Notepad and Text Edit to make websites, but there are other text editors available that might help you code more efficiently.

- Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text are all viable Third-Party options for text-editing.

- A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

- The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands.

- Within a terminal you have what is known as a shell. This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you.

- Whenever we refer to either a file or directory on the command line, we are in fact referring to a path. A path is a means to get to a particular file or directory on the system.
