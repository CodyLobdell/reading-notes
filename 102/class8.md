# Class 8 Notes

>> Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
 - Being one-dimensional, it only deals with layout in a single direction - columns or rows - at a time. This works well for smaller layouts, such as components
 
2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
 - The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis, therefore if your flex-direction (main axis) is set to row or row-reverse the cross axis runs down the columns.    If your main axis is column or column-reverse then the cross axis runs along the rows.
 - The main axis is defined by the direction the flex-items are being laid out. The start and end of this axis are called main-start and main-end. The flex-direction       property can determine the direction in which the main-axis is laid out.
 
3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
 - Major drawbacks of using flexbox are performance issues. The use of flexbox can increase the page loading time if you have a larger project. You can compare the        page loading time through Chrome development tools using the flexbox and the same pages constructed without using flexbox.
 

>> CSS Layout - Flexbox

Read up to “Flex-Flow Shorthand”

1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
 - Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.
 - Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.
 - Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.
 
2.How does this topic connect with your long term goals?
 - Flexbox has a feature for changing the layout order of flex items without affecting the source order. This is impossible to do with traditional layout methods.        Utilziing this, It enables me to quickly and efficiently produce quality code for ordered lists!
