# Class 1 Notes

-To begin, you'll need to answer these questions:

What is your website about? Do you like dogs, New York, or Pac-Man?
What information are you presenting on the subject? Write a title and a few paragraphs and think of an image you'd like to show on your page.
What does your website look like, in simple high-level terms? What's the background color? What kind of font is appropriate: formal, cartoony, bold and loud, subtle?

Choosing your assets
At this point, it's good to start putting together the content that will eventually appear on your webpage.

Text
You should still have your paragraphs and title from earlier. Keep these close by.

Theme color
To choose a color, go to the Color Picker and find a color you like. When you click on a color, you'll see a strange six-character code like #660066. That's called a hex code (short for hexadecimal), and represents your color. Copy the code down somewhere safe for now.


What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.

JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!

JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:

Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.

Introduction to HTML
At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.
