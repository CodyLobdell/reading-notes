# Class 3 Notes

>> Ordered and Unordered lists

1. When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?
  -When creating a list of related items, in no particular order.

2. How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?
  -If not present and if no CSS list-style-type property applies to the element, select a bullet type depending on the nesting level of the list.
  
3. When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?
  -Unordered list = NO particular order.
  -Ordered list = specific order.
  
4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?
  - <.ol.> OR <.ul.>

>> The Box Model.

1. Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?
   -Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties. 
   -Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin       and related properties.
     
2. List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.
   - The <.html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.
   - The <.body> element defines the document's body.
   - The <.h1> element defines a heading.
   - The <.p> element defines a paragraph.

  
>> Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops.

1. What data types can you store inside of an Array?
  - strings, numbers, objects,
  
2. Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?
  - Yes. You can access individual items in the array using bracket notation and supplying the item's index, 
    in the same way that you accessed the letters in a string. 
 
3. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.
  -  = Assigns the variable on the left the value stated on the right
    += Adds the value on the right to the variable value on the left, then returns the new variable value
    -= Subtracts the value on the right from the variable value on the left, and returns the new variable value
    *= Multiplies the variable value on the left by the value on the right, and returns the new variable value
    /= Divides the variable value on the left by the value on the right, and returns the new variable value
    
4. Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.
  - 10 dog
  
5. Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.
  - Passwords are “if, then” logic statements: If a user enters the correct password, then they can access the program.
  
6. Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.
  - Loops are all about doing the same thing over and over again. Often, the code will be slightly different each time round the loop, or the same code will run but       with different variables.
