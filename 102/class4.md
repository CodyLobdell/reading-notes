# Class 4 Notes

- Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product.
  With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design. Changes at these stages are much easierâ€”and therefore cheaperâ€”than changes deemed necessary after coding is under way.
  Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.

- There are heaps of free wireframe tools out there, so you should experiment with as many as you can to find the ones that suit you the best. Donâ€™t forget that you can also just use pen and paper! Below weâ€™ve listed three online tools we find particularly good. The examples below all have free trials, so check them out!
  - UXPin: UXPin has a wide range of functionalities, but one of the best ones is how it facilitates building responsive, clickable prototypes directly in your browser.
  - InVision: InVision allows you to get feedback straight from your team and users through clickable mock-ups of your site design. Itâ€™s completely free too!
  - Wireframe.cc: Wireframe.cc provides you with the technology to create wireframes really quickly within your browser, the online version of pen and paper.


- Wireframe Steps:
  - Research
  - Prepare your research for quick reference
  - Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
  - Draft, donâ€™t draw. Sketch, donâ€™t illustrate
  - Add some detail and get testing
  - Start turning your wireframes into prototypes


- HTML:
  - HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
  - The opening tag
  - The closing tag
  - The content
  - The element

- An attribute should always have the following:

  - A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
  - The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
  - The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.
