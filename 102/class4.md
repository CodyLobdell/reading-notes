# Class 4 Notes

>> Creating Hyperlinks

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
  - Inside an <a> element and using the href attribute

2. The href attribute contains what information?
  - The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. If the href attribute is not present, the <a> tag will not be a hyperlink.

3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
  - Create Accessible Hypertext Links
    Use concise and meaningful text for links.
    Do not capitalize all letters in links.
    Avoid using URLs for link text.
    Do not use the word "link" as part of the link text.
    Do not use tooltips/screentips to add additional information.

>> CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?
  - Normal flow is the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout.
  
2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
  - Block elements always start from a new line. Inline elements never start from a new line. Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. Inline     elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element.
  
3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.
  - "Static"
  
4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
  - Very good cross-browser support, Less dependence on floats, Less dependence on margins (can be buggy)
  
5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
  - Elements with fixed positioning are fixed with respect to the viewport—the viewport is always their containing block
  
>>Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code
  
1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
  - A function expression is very similar to and has almost the same syntax as a function declaration (see function statement for details). The main difference between     a function expression and a function declaration is the function name, which can be omitted in function expressions to create anonymous functions.
  
2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
  - The values that are declared within a function when the function is called are known as an argument. Whereas, the variables that are defined when the function is       declared are known as a parameter.
  
  
>> 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
  
  1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
  
    - Engaged collaboration: I need to open myself up to working alongside more peers I haven't had a chance to meet. i have always been comfortable to working in          team-based enviornments. Learning when to ask for help has always been one of my weak suits, and I know with the right people around It's easier for me to reach  
     out.
  
    - Job interview readiness: I definitely need to feel more comfortable with selling myself when it comes to something I still don't know a lot about. I'm sure by the end of this course I will feel better about it, but for now I still feel a little overwhelmed!
